# Plastic Trouble - BUas CMGT Programming Intake Assignment 2023
This is my game for the 2023 Programming Intake for Breda University of Applied Sciences CMGT.

# Summary
**Plastic Trouble** is a 2D Game which has the “Bounce” theme, exactly this year's intake assignment theme. You are a sea pickle and you want to clean sea water. The objective of the game is to pop all the balloons with plastic and get a good score. If you get hit by a balloon you will die. You have three difficulties and you need to pass them if you want to win.
